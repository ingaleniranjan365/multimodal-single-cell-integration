This repository is an experiment to solve multimoda-single-cell-integration(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-multimodal) using pysaprk.
While most solutions end up using stand alone libraries like sklearn, using spark allows distributed processing hence this solution can be used over a much larger dataset than one given in the problem for further research.
